# ServoPressKit App

## Overview

### What is Servo Press Kit

[Servo Press Kit](https://www.festo.com/cms/en-gb_gb/59135.htm) by Festo is a modular press-fitting kit with servo drive 
for electrical press-fitting and joining up to 17 kN.

### App

This app launches a web browser panel to visualise data stored in a log file generated by equipment from the
[Servo Press Kit](https://www.festo.com/cms/en-gb_gb/59135.htm) family. 

Once a log file is loaded, it plots the Force-Displacement graph from recorded points to analyse press 
scenarios which is key during press investigation.
Additionally, displays the log file summary including program name, timestamp, result, etc. and the source file 
‘last modification date’ which could indicate the original log file was modified.

press sequence, pass/fail criteria as well as placeholders for unused parameters. App needs to locate and extract all 
the relevant data inside the file in order to proceed.
